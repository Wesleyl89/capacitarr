## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

- Use the project's issue tracker to report bugs or request features
- Include as much detail as possible: steps to reproduce, expected behavior, actual behavior, environment details

### Submitting Changes

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch from `main` following branch naming conventions:
   - `feature/` — New features
   - `fix/` — Bug fixes
   - `refactor/` — Code refactoring
   - `docs/` — Documentation changes
   - `test/` — Test improvements
   - `chore/` — Maintenance tasks
3. Make your changes following the project's coding standards
4. Write clear, atomic commits using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:
   ```
   feat(component): add new feature
   fix(api): resolve connection timeout
   docs: update installation guide
   ```
5. Ensure all tests pass
6. Submit a merge request with a clear description of your changes

### Architecture

Capacitarr uses a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **HTTP Layer** — Thin route handlers that parse requests, call services, and return responses
- **Service Layer** — All business logic lives in `backend/internal/services/`. Each service receives a `*gorm.DB` and `*events.EventBus` via constructor injection — no global state
- **Event Bus** — A typed pub/sub system with fan-out to three subscribers: activity persister (dashboard feed), notification dispatcher (Discord/Slack/in-app), and SSE broadcaster (real-time browser updates)
- **Data Layer** — SQLite via GORM with a single baseline migration. Two purpose-specific tables: `approval_queue` (state machine) and `audit_log` (append-only history)

For the full architecture documentation with diagrams, see [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

### Code Standards

- **Go backend**: Follow `gofmt` formatting; `golangci-lint` is run automatically via Docker
- **Vue frontend**: Follow the project's ESLint and Prettier configuration
- **Commits**: Use Conventional Commits format (required for changelog generation)
- **Documentation**: Update relevant docs when changing user-facing behavior
- **Services**: New business logic should be added to the service layer, not inline in route handlers
- **Events**: All user-visible actions should publish typed events to the event bus

### Local Development Checks

Run the full CI pipeline locally before pushing:

```bash
make ci
```

This runs lint, test, and security checks using the **same Docker images** as the GitLab CI pipeline. No additional tool installation required beyond Docker and pnpm.

Individual stages can be run separately:

```bash
make lint:ci       # golangci-lint + ESLint + Prettier format check
make test:ci       # go test + vitest
make security:ci   # govulncheck + pnpm audit
```

For auto-fixing lint and formatting issues during development:

```bash
make lint          # ESLint --fix + golangci-lint (via Docker)
make format        # Prettier --write + gofmt
```

**Full build verification via Docker:**

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

> **Note:** Do not run the backend or frontend directly for testing. Use Docker Compose to ensure the build matches the production environment.

**Recommended workflow:**

```
make lint format → make ci → commit → push
     (fix)         (verify)
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

Every push and merge request triggers a GitLab CI pipeline with these stages:

1. **Lint** — `golangci-lint` (Go), ESLint + Prettier format check (frontend)
2. **Test** — `go test` and Vitest for the frontend
3. **Build** — Docker image build verification
4. **Security** — `govulncheck` (Go) and `pnpm audit` (frontend)

The `make ci` command runs the same checks using the same Docker images, so if it passes locally it will pass in CI. Ensure all CI checks pass before requesting review.

### Merge Request Guidelines

- Keep MRs focused — one logical change per MR
- Include tests for new functionality where possible
- Update documentation if your change affects user-facing behavior
- Respond to review feedback promptly
